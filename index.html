        <h1>Nandish Rana</h1>
        <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong>Rana Futuristics</strong> and <a href="https://pakka.io/"><strong>Pakka.io</strong></a></em></p>
        <p>
          A passionate explorer at heart, I've always been captivated by the intricacies of Science and Engineering.
          As an early adopter, I embarked on the journey of LLMs and NLP before the rise of ChatGPT. Currently, I'm delving into the realms of Web3,
          while simultaneously gaining insights into the human psyche and the intricate tapestry of financial markets.
          Further augmenting my knowledge, I am currently enrolled in a business course, looking to harness its teachings to create revolutionary projects.
          <br>
          Guided by the ethos of the entrepreneurial vanguards before me, I carry forward their legacy with pride.
          In my leisure, I revel in the world of video games and am an avid otaku. The vastness of the universe beckons, and I'm on a mission to explore its myriad wonders. Peace out!
          <br>
          I established my company as a haven for visionaries and trailblazers, eager to collaborate and make a dent in the universe.
